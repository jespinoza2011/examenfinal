Minesweeper

Have you ever played Minesweeper? This cute little game comes with a certain operating system whose name we can't remember. The goal of the game is to find where all the mines are located within a M x N field.
The game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. Each square has at most eight adjacent squares. The 4 x 4 field on the left contains two mines, each represented by a ``*'' character. If we represent the same field by the hint numbers described above, we end up with the field on the right:

*...
....
.*..
....
*100
2210
1*10
1110

Input

The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m ( 0 < n, m100) which stand for the number of lines and columns of the field, respectively. Each of the next n lines contains exactly m characters, representing the field.

Safe squares are denoted by ``.'' and mine squares by ``*,'' both without the quotes. The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.

Output

For each field, print the message Field #x: on a line alone, where x stands for the number of the field starting from 1. The next n lines should contain the field with the ``.'' characters replaced by the number of mines adjacent to that square. There must be an empty line between field outputs.

Sample Input

 4 4
*...
....
.*..
....
3 5
**...
.....
.*...
0 0

Sample Output

Field #1:
*100
2210
1*10
1110

Field #2:
**100
33200
1*100
